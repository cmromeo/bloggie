# Readable API Server

This is the nodejs backend for the final assessment project for Udacity's React + Redux course where I built a content and comment web app. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This repository includes the code for the backend API Server that I used to develop and interact with the front-end portion of the project.

## API Server

Information about the API server and how to use it can be found in its [README file](api-server/README.md).
