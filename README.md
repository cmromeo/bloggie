# Readable API Server

The nodejs backend for the final assessment project was provided for by Udacity's React + Redux course where I built a content and comment web app on top of it. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This repository includes the code for the backend API Server that I used to develop and interact with the front-end portion of the project.

## API Server

Information about the API server and how to use it can be found in its [README file](api-server/README.md).

### To use my code:

After cloning my code using:
    git clone  https://github.com/cmromeo/bloggie.git 
cd to the directory

A. Install and start the API server in the terminal window using the commands: 
    cd api-server
    npm install
    node server
B. In another terminal window, use Create React App to scaffold out the front-end
    cd frontend
    npm start
